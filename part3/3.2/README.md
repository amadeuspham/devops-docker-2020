# CI Pipeline of Random Jokes, Docker Hub & Hekoru

I used CircleCI to deploy [Random Jokes](https://github.com/amadeuspham/randomjokes) to Docker Hub and Heroku. This is the [circleci config file](https://github.com/amadeuspham/randomjokes/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml), in which I used orbs for docker and heroku.
